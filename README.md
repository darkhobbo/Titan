A recreation of https://github.com/chadfawcett/mailhound in Python using Flask. Once set up, the submitted form data will be sent to a mail provider like [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) or [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com) and then forwarded to another email that can be specified in an environment variable.

For hosting I utilized Heroku.
